# Data Journalism and D3


The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. Their hope is that being able to visualize their data will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding..) on issues facing our planet.

Data is retrieved from two different sites on the web (https://earthquake.usgs.gov and https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fraxen/tectonicplates/master ) and then charted on screen to provide the user a way to contrast the earthquake information against the tectonic plates placement.
